carbonzipper: carbonserver proxy for graphite-web
=================================================

CarbonZipper is the central part of a replacement graphite storage stack.  It
proxies requests from graphite-web to a cluster of carbon storage backends.
Previous versions (available in the git history) were able to talk to python
carbon stores, but the current version requires the use of CarbonServer
( https://github.com/grobian/carbonserver ).

Configuration is done via a JSON file loaded at startup.  The only required
field is the list of carbonserver backends to connect to.

Other pieces of the stack are:
   - carbonapi ( https://github.com/dgryski/carbonapi )
   - carbonmem ( https://github.com/dgryski/carbonmem )
